# 🌙 Sleep Cycle Calculator (Multilingual)

A simple, single-page web application designed to help users determine the optimal time to go to sleep or wake up based on 90-minute sleep cycles. By waking up at the end of a full cycle, you can minimize grogginess and wake up feeling refreshed.

This application is built entirely in a single HTML file using **vanilla JavaScript** for logic and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, dark-mode, responsive interface.

  - **When to Wake**: Calculates when you should go to sleep if you need to wake up at a specific time.
  - **When to Sleep**: Calculates when you should wake up if you go to sleep at a specific time.
  - **Sleep Now**: Calculates your ideal wake-up times starting from the current moment.

- **Sleep Latency Toggle**

## 😴 The 90-Minute Cycle

The calculation is based on the premise that a full **sleep cycle lasts approximately 90 minutes**.

- Waking up at the **end** of a sleep cycle (during lighter sleep) can:
  - Reduce **sleep inertia** (the groggy feeling upon waking).
  - Help you feel **more refreshed**, even if total sleep time is slightly shorter.

The application suggests between:

- **1 to 6 cycles**
- Corresponding to **1.5 hours to 9 hours** of sleep.

Each recommended time is calculated as:

> base time ± (90 minutes × number of cycles) [+ 15-minute latency if enabled]
